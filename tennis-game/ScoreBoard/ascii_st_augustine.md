We need to make a tennis scoreboard with ASCII characters.  Here is the list of characters that we need to use:
```bash
 _  ___    ____   ___    _____  ___    _  _    ___       _       _   _ 
/ |/ _ \  |___ \ / _ \  |___ / / _ \  | || |  / _ \     / \   __| | | |
| | | | |   __) | | | |   |_ \| | | | | || |_| | | |   / _ \ / _` | | |
| | |_| |  / __/| |_| |  ___) | |_| | |__   _| |_| |  / ___ \ (_| | | |
|_|\___/  |_____|\___/  |____/ \___/     |_|  \___/  /_/   \_\__,_| | |
 / _ \                                                              |_|
| (_) |                                                                
 \___/

 ```

 I need a python script that will output a "10" as shown above, but this time I would like the "10" to be filled with a yellow color if that is possible.

 I want you to act as a seasoned tennis scoreboard developer and write the "view" part of a scoreboard.
 Please watch the attached video and give me the C++ code that will output the "10" as shown above and also position the "10" and the other player's score like "20" and put them in the positions that are shown in the video.  Use ASCII art to mimic the scoreboard shown in the video.
