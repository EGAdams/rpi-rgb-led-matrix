# some library in jacksonville

Good Afternoon, Roy

Thank you for the update.

I hope that your weekend is going well.  I see that some people are still celebrating the 4th.

I think I will be able to show the tie-break scenario soon.  I will give you another update before dark.

It will be good news.
