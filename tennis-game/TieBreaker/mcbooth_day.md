Here is some example C++ Source code that compiles and runs.
```cpp
TEST_F(TieBreakerTest, InitializeTieBreakMode) {
    _tieBreaker->initializeTieBreakMode();
    EXPECT_EQ(_tieBreaker->getIteration(), 1);
    EXPECT_EQ(_player1->getPoints(), 0);
    EXPECT_EQ(_player2->getPoints(), 0);
    EXPECT_EQ(_gameState->getServeSwitch(), 1);
    EXPECT_EQ(_gameState->getServe(), 0);
}
```

Please use this for a working syntax example.  Don't worry about the getServeSwitch() stuff that is different from yours, just rewrite all of those simple tests that you wrote before but this time us C++ and the working example to help you with the syntax.
