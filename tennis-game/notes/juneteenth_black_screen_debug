Got ERROR_EMAIL_ALREADY_IN_USE error.

I have debugged all of the WebView errors.  There was a Firebase error that I finally found out was caused by not having an authentication method selected in the firebase console.
I selected the Email/Passoword method to get rid of the error. Now, a newly created user is not showing up in the MCBA user database.  I am still in the process of debugging this.
